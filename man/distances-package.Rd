\title{distances: Tools for Distance Metrics}
\description{
The \code{distances} package provides tools for constructing, manipulating
and using distance metrics in R. It calculates distances only as needed
(unlike the standard \code{\link[stats]{dist}} function which derives the
complete distance matrix when called). This saves memory and can increase
speed. The package also includes functions for fast nearest and farthest
neighbor searching.
