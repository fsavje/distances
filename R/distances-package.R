#' distances: Tools for Distance Metrics
#'
#' The \code{distances} package provides tools for constructing, manipulating
#' and using distance metrics in R. It calculates distances only as needed
#' (unlike the standard \code{\link[stats]{dist}} function which derives the
#' complete distance matrix when called). This saves memory and can increase
#' speed. The package also includes functions for fast nearest and farthest
#' neighbor searching.
#'
#' See the package's website for more information:
#' \url{https://github.com/fsavje/distances}.
#'
#' Bug reports and suggestions are greatly appreciated. They
#' are best reported here:
#' \url{https://github.com/fsavje/distances/issues/new}.
